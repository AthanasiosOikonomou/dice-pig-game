# Pig Game

Pig Game is a simple dice game for two players.
The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points.
Players take turns rolling a single six-sided die as many times as they wish, accumulating points.
If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points for that turn, and it becomes the next player's turn.
Players can choose to "hold" to add their current turn's points to their total score and pass the turn to the other player.
